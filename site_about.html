A front-end developer is responsible for building a website or application with a pleasant user experience. That means it looks good and works the way it should.
            Frontend developers are typically not responsible for website design. However, they will work closely with the UI and UX designers to turn their ideas into reality.              
            Once the website or app is built, front-end developers are responsible for maintenance, testing, and ongoing developments like feature updates.
